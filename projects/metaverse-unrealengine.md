One of projects i worked on in Accenture, that aims to revolutionize how manufacturing facilities are designed by utilizing advanced digital tools and simulations, specify layout requirements. 

My key contributions into project development are:
* Application Design: maintainable and modular & scaleable core
* Gizmo and Grid / Snapping System: Gizmo-module user interaction tools for runtime object manipulation
* Asset Management: Subsystem for loading and managing model sets, workflows for handling large datasets
* User Interface: UI controls and menus, dynamic layouts, input bindings
* Camera Setup: Various camera modes to switch between viewing modes
