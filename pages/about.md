# Hey there! 
CubeElement is home to the projects of one humble developer.

>**CubeElement** is all about keeping things simple and connected. The "cube" stands for the most basic three-dimensional shape, representing stability and structure. Think of it as the building block of geometry! The "element" is like a key piece that needs to be part of the bigger picture to really matter. Together, CubeElement captures the idea that every great creation starts with simple, solid parts that come together to make something meaningful.

I’m a software developer, and honestly, I love what I do. There’s something incredibly satisfying about building efficient software and tackling those tricky coding challenges, especially in the Linux environment. It’s like solving a puzzle, and I’m always up for the challenge!

C++ is my go-to language, and I've been using it for years in all sorts of projects - not just game development and Digital Twins. I've got a solid grasp of software engineering principles, and I love figuring out how to apply them to real-world problems. I've worked with Unreal Engine, but my experience with C++ goes way beyond that. I'm all about understanding the fundamentals of computer science and how they can be used to solve complex problems, regardless of the language or domain. I'm also curious about other languages like Go, Lua and Python, and I enjoy exploring how tools like CMake and Docker can help me build better software.

I believe that good software development is about more than just writing code; it’s about understanding user needs and delivering solutions that solve real problems.
Collaboration is a big part of my journey; I love bouncing ideas off others and learning from different perspectives.

Outside of coding, I dive into open-source projects and keep my curiosity alive by exploring the latest tech trends. I’m excited about the possibilities ahead and can’t wait to connect with others who share this passion.
